        <h6>SOFTWOOD</h6>
      <p> Trees are generally classified into either Hardwoods or Softwoods. Inexplicably, not all softwoods are
          soft and not all hardwoods are hard. For example, balsa, a hardwood, produces one of the softest
          woods in the world. Conversely, Douglas fir, a softwood, is harder and has better strength properties
          than many hardwoods. In simple terms, softwoods are needle-bearing trees and hardwoods are leaf-
          bearing. <Strong [routerLink]="['/extract1']" style="cursor:pointer;">Read More</Strong>

        <h6>HOW A TREE GROWS</h6>
        <p> â€¢ Seeds are dispersed from a mature tree in a number of ways: Some seeds have
            broad-bladed wings to catch the wind, others have hooks to grab insects or are
            scented to attract birds. Most seeds never make it to a fertile spot where the
            conditions are right for sprouting.
